# Which technologies did I use to develop this app? :thinking:

It is a web app made with Angular 12 + TypeScript + Bootstrap 5 + Mapbox. <br>
I used Angular-CLI to create my Angular App. <br>

# Which is the purpose of this web app? :thinking:

It is a web app I made based on Fernando Herrera Angular course üßê. I havent made barely changes compared to the project that Fernando Herrera made on the course, but just because I want to learn and adquire the Angular knowledge ü§ì. I know the styles are very basic, but I just focused on Angular stuff. I learnt with this project about:

‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about making reusable components in Angular. <br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Good practices about Angular folder structure. <br>
:blue_heart: Working in TypeScript with a library written in JavaScript (Mapbox: https://www.mapbox.com/). <br>
:world_map: How to world with Mapbox at a basic level: adding zoom, adding/updating/deleting markers etc. <br>
:compass: Saving markers in localStorage, updating their position in real time. <br>
:airplane: Creation of a screen with different maps in it. <br>
:blue_heart: TypeScript. <br>
:art: Bootstrap 5.  <br>
